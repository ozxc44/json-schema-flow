Show HN: JSON Schema Flow – Visual JSON to JSON Schema converter
```

#### Description
```
Hi HN,

I built JSON Schema Flow [1], a free online tool that converts JSON to JSON Schema with a visual tree preview.

I often found myself manually writing JSON Schemas for API validation and TypeScript projects. Existing tools were either CLI-heavy or produced unreadable schemas.

JSON Schema Flow:
- Real-time conversion as you type
- Visual tree structure showing your schema hierarchy
- One-click TypeScript interface export
- Supports all JSON Schema versions (draft-04 through 2020-12)
- 100% client-side – nothing leaves your browser
- No sign-up required

It's open source (MIT) and deployed on GitHub Pages. Looking for feedback on:
- Would you use this over CLI tools? Why/why not?
- Any features that would make this indispensable?

```

#### Post

I built a free tool for generating JSON Schemas visually. It converts any JSON to JSON Schema with:

- Live preview with tree visualization
- TypeScript interface export (one click)
- All schema versions (draft-04/07, 2019-09, 2020-12)
- No sign-up, runs entirely in browser

Built for my own workflow – generating schemas for API validation and TypeScript types. Would love feedback from other JS/TS developers!
